# Specialized AI Tools
## Technical AI
> [!WARNING]
> The Usage of AI to technical fields is currently at an underperforming state in 2026. Please note that the usage of "Vibe" + (Thechnical Thing) is a very risky thing.
> Please do not belive the hype! Although AI is constatly evolving, it cannot create high level programs and is quite literaly years away from actual industry use case and would require multiple miracles in a short time span to beat the AI bubble.

## Non-Technical AI (Creative)
> [!WARNING]
> The Usage of AI to replace creative works is not condoned in any way or form. These AI tools are meant to help or benefit **CREATORS** during the process of music creation and must not be used as a means to hit upload.

### Writing
> [!WARNING]
> 🟢**Correct Usage Example**🟢: If you were to make a document for reseach purpouses and need proper grammer or syntax, its totaly fine to use AI, or perhaps its usage in documentation or emails, etc. Also you can make "Generic" content, such as Landing Pages, Social Bio, Descriptions, notices, etc.
> 
> 🔴**Incorrect Usage Example**🔴: Literally any form of "Creative" writing such as novels, worlds, and stories, but can be extended to motivational works or self help books and a few other misc cases (The usage of AI in creative writing perhaps may be worse than some of the worst pieces of media till date. Due to the fact that it is very easy to make SLOP using AI being almost indistinguishable from human writing, making the entire art of writing ashamed. **"U can using the bad grammer in book writing"**, and you will be left with more good reviews than with any piece of AI writing.)

> 
> 🔴**Incorrect Usage Example**🔴: Generating music without any knowhow of music and uploading it without any majour changes
> (And no, uploading lyrics does not constitute as musical creative direction. Perhaps lyrical but not musical in any way).
